    "answer": "Photons in UV light have more energy than the work function of the metal; visible light photons do not.",
    "hint": "Consider photon energy in UV vs visible light.",
    "explanation": "UV light has shorter wavelengths and higher energy per photon. Only light with photon energy greater than the metal’s work function causes electron emission.",

      "options": ["Red", "Orange", "Blue", "Infrared"],
      "correct": "Blue",
      "explanation": "Blue light has a shorter wavelength and higher photon energy than yellow, making it more likely to emit electrons."
